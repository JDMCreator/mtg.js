## Mtg.js
####Version 0.4 BETA

##### What is it ?
Mtg.js is an offline javascript environment to search the Magic The Gathering's database. It includes a built-in web-based console.

##### How to install

Download the ZIP at your right, then uncompress the folder named **mtg**. You can then start writing code in the **index.html** file.

##### Don't know how to program ?

No problem ! Install Mtg.js, open **index.html** and click **Run**. Mtg.js comes with a pre-built search engine which uses almost the same syntax as Magiccards.info

##### How can I upgrade to database ?

Open **JSFileGenerator.html** and follow the instructions. Mtg.js uses the data from http://mtgjson.com/

##### Where is the api ?

Open **documentation/api.html**. Everything should be there.

##### I found a bug, what can I do ?

Mtg.js is new, so that's normal. Report it using Github.

##### Are there any other way to contact you ?

You can contact me via Reddit (u/JDMCreator). However, if this is to report a bug, please use Github.

##### License ?
